# advanced-information-system-analysis-design
A system analysis and design project for an app called **RaceCart**, a fictional mobile application that allows users to book go-kart sessions, manage reservations, leave reviews, and participate in forums.   This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Information Systems Analysis &amp; Design (AISAD)** coursework.  

## Project Overview
RaceCart is designed to simplify the process of booking and managing go-kart rides.  
Users can **register, order, cancel, review, and interact through a forum**, while admins manage carts, orders, and reporting.  
The project emphasizes **UML modeling, system architecture, and database design**.  

## Objectives
- Model the functional and non-functional requirements of a go-kart booking system.  
- Create detailed UML diagrams to describe workflows and interactions.  
- Design system architecture with a three-tier model for security and scalability.  
- Map use cases to CRUD operations and database entities.  

## Contents
- **Activity Diagrams**, User workflows for registration, booking, and more.  
- **Use Case Descriptions**, Detailed steps, exceptions, and stakeholders.  
- **System Sequence Diagrams**, Userâ€“system interaction flows.  
- **System Architecture**, Three-tier design (client, app server, database).  
- **Database Design**, Schema and example records for key tables.  
- **Class Diagrams & CRC Cards**, Object-oriented system structure.  
- **Sequence & Communication Diagrams**, Data and process flows.  
- **Package Diagram**, Modular organization of system components.

## Tools & Methodologies
- **Modeling Language**: UML (Use Case, Activity, Class, Sequence, State Machine, CRC, Package)  
- **Methodology**: Structured System Analysis & Design  
- **Core Skills**: Requirements Analysis, Diagramming, Database Design
